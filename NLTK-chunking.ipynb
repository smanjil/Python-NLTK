       " u'We have gathered under this Capitol dome in moments of national mourning and national achievement.',\n",
       " u'We have served America through one of the most consequential periods of our history -- and it has been my honor to serve with you.',\n",
       " u'In a system of two parties, two chambers, and two elected branches, there will always be differences and debate.',\n",
       " u'But even tough debates can be conducted in a civil tone, and our differences cannot be allowed to harden into anger.',\n",
       " u'To confront the great issues before us, we must act in a spirit of goodwill and respect for one another -- and I will do my part.',\n",
       " u'Tonight the state of our Union is strong -- and together we will make it stronger.',\n",

       " u'We will choose to act confidently in pursuing the enemies of freedom -- or retreat from our duties in the hope of an easier life.',\n",
       " u'We will choose to build our prosperity by leading the world economy -- or shut ourselves off from trade and opportunity.',\n",
       " u'In a complex and challenging time, the road of isolationism and protectionism may seem broad and inviting -- yet it ends in danger and decline.',\n",
       " u'The only way to protect our people, the only way to secure the peace, the only way to control our destiny is by our leadership -- so the United States of America will continue to lead.',\n",
       " u'(Applause.)',\n",
       " u'Abroad, our nation is committed to an historic, long-term goal -- we seek the end of tyranny in our world.',\n",

       " u'In reality, the future security of America depends on it.',\n",
       " u'On September the 11th, 2001, we found that problems originating in a failed and oppressive state 7,000 miles away could bring murder and destruction to our country.',\n",

       " u'And we do not forget the other half -- in places like Syria and Burma, Zimbabwe, North Korea, and Iran -- because the demands of justice, and the peace of this world, require their freedom, as well.',\n",

       " u'Terrorists like bin Laden are serious about mass murder -- and all of us must take their declared intentions seriously.',\n",
       " u'They seek to impose a heartless system of totalitarian control throughout the Middle East, and arm themselves with weapons of mass murder.',\n",
       " u'Their aim is to seize power in Iraq, and use it as a safe haven to launch attacks against America and the world.',\n",
       " u'Lacking the military strength to challenge us directly, the terrorists have chosen the weapon of fear.',\n",
       " u'When they murder children at a school in Beslan, or blow up commuters in London, or behead a bound captive, the terrorists hope these horrors will break our will, allowing the violent to inherit the Earth.',\n",

       " u'And there is no honor in retreat.',\n",
       " u'By allowing radical Islam to work its will -- by leaving an assaulted world to fend for itself -- we would signal to all that we no longer believe in our own ideals, or even in our own courage.',\n",

       " u'We are the nation that saved liberty in Europe, and liberated death camps, and helped raise up democracies, and faced down an evil empire.',\n",

       " u\"Second, we're continuing reconstruction efforts, and helping the Iraqi government to fight corruption and build a modern economy, so all Iraqis can experience the benefits of freedom.\",\n",

       " u'(Applause.)',\n",
       " u'Our work in Iraq is difficult because our enemy is brutal.',\n",
       " u'But that brutality has not stopped the dramatic progress of a new democracy.',\n",
       " u'In less than three years, the nation has gone from dictatorship to liberation, to sovereignty, to a constitution, to national elections.',\n",
       " u'At the same time, our coalition has been relentless in shutting off terrorist infiltration, clearing out insurgent strongholds, and turning over territory to Iraqi security forces.',\n",
       " u'I am confident in our plan for victory; I am confident in the will of the Iraqi people; I am confident in the skill and spirit of our military.',\n",
       " u'Fellow citizens, we are in this fight to win, and we are winning.',\n",
       " u'(Applause.)',\n",
       " u'The road of victory is the road that will take our troops home.',\n",
       " u'As we make progress on the ground, and Iraqi forces increasingly take the lead, we should be able to further decrease our troop levels -- but those decisions will be made by our military commanders, not by politicians in Washington, D.C.',\n",

       " u'Our coalition has learned from our experience in Iraq.',\n",

       " u'In the coming year, I will continue to reach out and seek your good advice.',\n",
       " u'Yet, there is a difference between responsible criticism that aims for success, and defeatism that refuses to acknowledge anything but failure.',\n",
       " u'(Applause.)',\n",
       " u'Hindsight alone is not wisdom, and second-guessing is not a strategy.',\n",
       " u'(Applause.)',\n",
       " u'With so much in the balance, those of us in public office have a duty to speak with candor.',\n",
       " u'A sudden withdrawal of our forces from Iraq would abandon our Iraqi allies to death and prison, would put men like bin Laden and Zarqawi in charge of a strategic country, and show that a pledge from America means little.',\n",
       " u'Members of Congress, however we feel about the decisions and debates of the past, our nation has only one option: We must keep our word, defeat our enemies, and stand behind the American military in this vital mission.',\n",

       " u'(Applause.)',\n",
       " u'Third, we need to encourage children to take more math and science, and to make sure those courses are rigorous enough to compete with other nations.',\n",
       " u\"We've made a good start in the early grades with the No Child Left Behind Act, which is raising standards and lifting test scores across our country.\",\n",
       " u'Tonight I propose to train 70,000 high school teachers to lead advanced-placement courses in math and science, bring 30,000 math and science professionals to teach in classrooms, and give early help to students who struggle with math, so they have a better chance at good, high-wage jobs.',\n",
       " u\"If we ensure that America's children succeed in life, they will ensure that America succeeds in the world.\",\n",

       " u'These gains are evidence of a quiet transformation -- a revolution of conscience, in which a rising generation is finding that a life of personal responsibility is a life of fulfillment.',\n",
       " u'Government has played a role.',\n",
       " u'Wise policies, such as welfare reform and drug education and support for abstinence and adoption have made a difference in the character of our country.',\n",
       " u'And everyone here tonight, Democrat and Republican, has a right to be proud of this record.',\n",
       " u'(Applause.)',\n",
